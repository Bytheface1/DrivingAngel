# DrivingAngel Android APP
**Author:** Joel Panisello
## Abstract
A proportion of road accidents are due to fatigue. To try to avoid them, truck transport professionals must stop every so often, but there are many other drivers who are not subject to tachograph monitoring.
The project consists of designing a mobile application that recognises how long the user has been driving and makes recommendations to stop and rest.
The application will use a smartwatch with Android Wear OS to monitor both the driver's activity (driving or resting) and heart rate to prevent accidents by warning the driver with an audible alarm.
**Key Words:** mobile application, smartwatches, detection of drowsiness.
## Objectives ##
The objectives of this thesis in computer science are detailed as follows:
- Analysis of different projects similar to this one.
- Creation of an application developed in Kotlin capable of detecting a Smartwatch using BLE technology.
- Creation of an application for Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 capable of reading heartbeats thanks to its sensors to   send them to the mobile APP.
- Implementation of a drowsiness detection algorithm that, using the previous readings of the watch, can detect   the user's state and warn him/her with a vibration on the watch or a sound on his/her mobile phone.
  o Visualisation of the heartbeats obtained on the screen by means of a line graph in real time.
